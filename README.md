The aim of this mini-project is to treat an image as a perturbation to a 2D square potential, then solving Schrodinger equation with this image potential for eigenstates and energy eigenvalues. 

The repository contains 2 Python modules, playground.py and Quantum.py, and an image lenna.jpg. 
    - lenna.jpg is just a sample image. 
    - Quantum.py contains the code that will process the image, solve the Schrodinger equation and display the results.
    - playground.py demonstrates what the code in Quantum.py can do, e.g. display the perturbed eigenstates, animate the time evolution of a linear superposition of states. The code in playground.py is split into sections. You have to run the first section first, then you can any section in any order you prefer. lenna.jpg is chosen as an example, but you can replace it with any image of your choices.
